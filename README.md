   - Create a new environment.
   - Import the JSON files from the `json` folder in this repository.
   - Start the Mockoon server.

## Notes

- The app requires the Mockoon server running with the JSON data provided in the `json` folder to display restaurant lists and details.
- Deep links will navigate directly to restaurant details if the app is running.
